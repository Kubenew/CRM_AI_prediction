Machine learning for customer churn prediction in a CRM system
 first import the necessary libraries and load the customer data from a CSV file. We preprocess the data by dropping the 'Customer ID' and 'Churn' columns and splitting it into training and test sets. We then train a Random Forest Classifier on the training set and use it to predict churn on the test set. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the model using the accuracy_score function.

This is an example of how machine learning can be used in a CRM system. In practice, more advanced techniques like deep learning and natural language processing can be used to gain insights from customer data and provide personalized experiences.
